# Maximize profits for the Wyndor Window and Door company.
# This version is modified to include all three constraint types.
# The answer is the same as for the original problem.
# This problem is different from wyndor-6 in that the order of 
# the constraints is reversed.

# Ans. is x1=2.0, x2=6.0, Z=36.0.
